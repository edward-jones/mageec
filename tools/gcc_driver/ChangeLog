2017-04-19  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Create more wrappers for various mpi*
	commands.
	* Driver.cpp: Remove -fmageec-gcc, -fmageec-g++ and
	-fmageec-gfortran arguments. Instead, find the compiler
	command to use by removing 'mageec-' from the front
	of the command word.

2017-04-12  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp (main): Initialize the 1NN machine learner.

2017-04-11  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp (main): For now, don't store the compilation
	command for each compilation. This takes up a huge amount of
	space (>2kB for each compilation).

2017-03-09  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp (main): When optimizing, only add a flag if it is
	actually enabled by the machine learner.

2017-03-03  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Add -fmageec-sql-trace argument to the Driver.

2017-02-22  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Don't allow both -fbranch-target-load-optimize and
	-fbranch-target-load-optimize2 to run.

2017-02-14  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Remove some flags unavailable in gcc 4.5
	* Parameter.h: Likewise.

2017-02-14  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp (main): Refactor. Always provide -O3 on the
	command line when both gathering and optimizing.

2017-01-25  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp (main): Fix check of the command word to handle
	absolute paths.

2017-01-24  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Add a symlink from mageec-gcc to mageec-g++ at
	install time.
	* Driver.cpp: Add the ability to specify a command to invokve g++
	from the GCC wrapper. Depending on whether the mageec-gcc,
	mageec-gfortran or mageec-g++ is called this will use the
	corresponding command -fmageec-g?? command from the command line.

2017-01-24  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Convert input filenames to be absolute filenames for
	internal use.

2017-01-20  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Add a symlink from mageec-gcc to
	mageec-fortran at install time.
	* Driver.cpp: Add the ability to specific a command to invoke
	gfortran from the GCC wrapper. When the driver is used, it will
	use the provided fortran compiler or c compiler depending on
	whether the driver is called through mageec-gcc or
	mageec-gfortran.
	(main): Refactor the argument handling to cope with fortran file,
	and input file provided mid-way through the command line string.

2017-01-20  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Remove some unnecessary flags.
	* Parameters.h: Likewise.

2017-01-10  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Compare feature file entries on the name of the
	program unit. Relax an overly aggressive warning to remove
	false positives.

2017-01-10  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Use strings instead of UUIDs as identifiers.

2016-11-28  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Comment out -fsection-anchors and
	-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars flags.
	* Parameters.h: Likewise.

2016-10-25  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp (loadFeatureIDs): Handle additional feature_class
	entry in csv file containing feature set identifiers.
	(main): When optimizing, only use the features which are classified
	as module features by the feature class.

2016-09-22  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Use getFeatureGroupFeatures instead of getFeatures.

2016-09-21  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Pass the command used to compile modules and
	functions to Database::newCompilation.

2016-09-21  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Generate compilation ids for functions as well as
	modules.

2016-09-19  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Use -mageec-gcc to replace the original command word

2016-09-19  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Remove -mageec-config option, and add
	-mageec-features and -mageec-out options.

2016-09-19  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Add -mageec-gcc option to specify the command to
	invoke gcc.

2016-09-19  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Refactor. Add ability to optimize using a selected
	machine learner.

2016-08-23  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Reimplement driver so that it's interface matches
	that of gcc

2016-08-16  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Rename gcc_driver target executable to mageec-gcc

2016-08-16  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>

	* Driver.cpp: Add 'gather' functionality to the driver

2016-08-15  Edward Jones  <ed.jones@embecosm.com>
