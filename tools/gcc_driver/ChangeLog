	* CMakeLists.txt: Add a symlink from mageec-gcc to
	mageec-fortran at install time.
	* Driver.cpp: Add the ability to specific a command to invoke
	gfortran from the GCC wrapper. When the driver is used, it will
	use the provided fortran compiler or c compiler depending on
	whether the driver is called through mageec-gcc or
	mageec-gfortran.
	(main): Refactor the argument handling to cope with fortran file,
	and input file provided mid-way through the command line string.

	* Driver.cpp (loadFeatureIDs): Handle additional feature_class
	entry in csv file containing feature set identifiers.
	(main): When optimizing, only use the features which are classified
	as module features by the feature class.
