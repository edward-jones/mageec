@chapter Building MAGEEC
MAGEEC uses the CMake build system.

The build and installation can be configured using @command{cmake} provided
with the path of the main source directory. The build should take place in a
directory separate to the source.

@example
cd path/to/mageec
cd ../
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../mageec ...
@end example

Available configuration options can be discovered by provided @code{--help} to
@command{cmake}. The most useful of these is the
@code{-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PREFIX} options which is used to set the
installation location; tools will be installed into @code{PREFIX/bin},
libraries into @code{PREFIX/lib} and headers into @code{PREFIX/include}.

Once configured, MAGEEC can be build using:

@example
make all
@end example

It can then be installed using:

@example
make install
@end example
